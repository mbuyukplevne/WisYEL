# WisYEL

### WisYEL is a placement test developed by me with SwiftUI to determine your English level. I use the Firebase Firestore database to pull the questions, options and the correct answer. Also, I can see the usage graph of the application by keeping the number of anonymous users who solved the test without requiring registration to the application.
